# AD Rebuild

Could the C:\Windows\NTDS database be captured from the live domain and restored to a secondary one.

Using this process, could we fail over domain controllers to their counter parts and have zero effect to the domain. Without Kerberos, would communication using tokens decouples from the domain effect it?
